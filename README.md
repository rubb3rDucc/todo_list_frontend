# Not Another Todo List!

Yes, this is another todo application. I am making this application to learn modern React techniques and tooling (Vite), Testing (unit, integration, and regression), CI/CD, Express/Node, and Postgres.

Plus, I never made a todo list when I started out programming, like many others have done before me.

# How it's going
- Users can add and delete todos
- It doesn't crash lol
- [backend server repo](https://github.com/rubb3rDucc/todo_list_server)

# Todos for the Todos
- [ ] The API route/url for toggling whether the todo is completed or not does not work when setting the toggle to false.
- [ ] Can not edit todos
- [ ] The app looks ugly
- [ ] User login/logout does not work and it's currently set on one user for testing the dashboard functionality
- [ ] Setup CI/CD pipeline with Github Actions with either Node or Docker, or both.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
